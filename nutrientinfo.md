# Protein (g)

The Dietary Reference Intake (DRI) value for protein is provided here as the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for protein. An RDA is the average daily dietary intake level sufficient to meet the nutrient requirements of nearly all (97–98 percent) healthy individuals in a group.

The Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Range (AMDR) for protein is defined as a range of intake - with a lower and upper boundary - that is associated with reduced risk of chronic disease while providing adequate intake of essential nutrients.

The AMDR for protein is expressed as a percentage of total energy intake because its requirement is not independent of other energy fuel sources or of the total energy requirement of the individual. Thus, the AMDR is not considered a Dietary Reference Intake (DRI) that provides a defined intake level.

The AMDR for protein is 5-20% of total energy intake for children age 1-3 years, 10-30% of total energy intake for children age 4-18 years, and 10-35% of total calories for adults.

# Carbohydrate (g)

The Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Range (AMDR) for carbohydrate is defined as a range of intake - with a lower and upper boundary - that is associated with reduced risk of chronic disease while providing adequate intake of essential nutrients.

The AMDR for carbohydrate is expressed as a percentage of total energy intake because its requirement is not independent of other energy fuel sources or of the total energy requirement of the individual. Thus, the AMDR is not considered a Dietary Reference Intake (DRI) that provides a defined intake level.

The AMDR for carbohydrate is 45-65% of total energy intake for children age 1-18 years and for adults. For infants age 0-12 months, an Adequate Intake (AI) has been established in place of an AMDR.

# Fiber, dietary (g)

The recommended amount of dietary fiber is 14 grams for every 1,000 calories per day. That results in around 25 g for women and 38 g for men. (Source: USDA)

A new analysis of almost 250 studies confirmed on a large scale that eating lots of fiber from vegetables, fruits, and whole grains can decrease your risk of dying from heart disease and cancer. Those who ate the most fiber reduced their risk of dying from cardiac disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes, and/or colon cancer by 16% to 24%, compared to people who ate very little fiber. The study also concluded that more fiber is better. For every additional 8 grams of dietary fiber a person consumed, the risk for each of the diseases fell by another 5% to 27%. Risk reductions were greatest when daily intake of dietary fiber was between 25 and 29 grams.

Eating too much fiber can cause bloating, gas, and constipation. These adverse effects may appear after eating 70 g of fiber in a day. (Source: medicalnewstoday)

# Fat (g)

The Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Range (AMDR) for fat is defined as a range of intake - with a lower and upper boundary - that is associated with reduced risk of chronic disease while providing adequate intake of essential nutrients.

The AMDR for fat is expressed as a percentage of total energy intake because its requirement is not independent of other energy fuel sources or of the total energy requirement of the individual. Thus, the AMDR is not considered a Dietary Reference Intake (DRI) that provides a defined intake level.

The AMDR for fat intake is 30-40% of total energy intake for children age 1-3 years, 25-35% of total energy intake for children age 4-18 years, and 20-35% of total energy intake for adults. For infants age 0-12 months, an Adequate Intake (AI) has been established in place of an AMDR.

# Omega-3 (ALA) (g)

Dietary Reference Intake (DRI) value for α-linolenic is represented by an Adequate Intake (AI), which represents the lower boundary of the Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Range (AMDR). The AI of 1.6 g for α-linolenic is based on the median intake of this fatty acid in the United States.

Dietary Reference Intake (DRI) value for linoleic acid is represented by an Adequate Intake (AI), which represents the lower boundary of the Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Range (AMDR). The AI of 17 g for linoleic acid is based on the median intake of this fatty acid in the United States.

# Choline (mg)

Choline is an essential nutrient that is naturally present in some foods and available as a dietary supplement. Choline is a source of methyl groups needed for many steps in metabolism. Humans can produce choline endogenously in the liver, mostly as phosphatidylcholine, but the amount that the body naturally synthesizes is not sufficient to meet human needs.

High intakes of choline are associated with a fishy body odor, vomiting, excessive sweating and salivation, hypotension, and liver toxicity [1,2]. Choline consumption has been shown to increase production of TMAO, a substance that has been linked to a higher risk of cardiovascular disease, in a dose-dependent manner in adults.

The FNB has established a AI of 550 mg/day for men and 425 mg/day for women, and UL of 3500mg for adults.

# sugar

A DRI for added sugars was not established. A maximal intake level of 25% or less of total calories from added sugars is suggested.

# vit A

max is for retinol only

# vit E, folate, niacin
As a-tocopherol; applies to any form of supplemental a-tocopherol
The ULs for vitamin E, niacin, and folate apply to synthetic forms obtained from supplements, fortified foods, or a combination of the two.

# Protein (g)

The Dietary Reference Intake (DRI) value for protein is provided here as the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for protein. An RDA is the average daily dietary intake level sufficient to meet the nutrient requirements of nearly all (97–98 percent) healthy individuals in a group.

The Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Range (AMDR) for protein is defined as a range of intake - with a lower and upper boundary - that is associated with reduced risk of chronic disease while providing adequate intake of essential nutrients.

The AMDR for protein is expressed as a percentage of total energy intake because its requirement is not independent of other energy fuel sources or of the total energy requirement of the individual. Thus, the AMDR is not considered a Dietary Reference Intake (DRI) that provides a defined intake level.

The AMDR for protein is 5-20% of total energy intake for children age 1-3 years, 10-30% of total energy intake for children age 4-18 years, and 10-35% of total calories for adults.

# Carbohydrate (g)

The Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Range (AMDR) for carbohydrate is defined as a range of intake - with a lower and upper boundary - that is associated with reduced risk of chronic disease while providing adequate intake of essential nutrients.

The AMDR for carbohydrate is expressed as a percentage of total energy intake because its requirement is not independent of other energy fuel sources or of the total energy requirement of the individual. Thus, the AMDR is not considered a Dietary Reference Intake (DRI) that provides a defined intake level.

The AMDR for carbohydrate is 45-65% of total energy intake for children age 1-18 years and for adults. For infants age 0-12 months, an Adequate Intake (AI) has been established in place of an AMDR.

# Fiber, total dietary (g)

The recommended amount of dietary fiber is 14 grams for every 1,000 calories per day. That results in around 25 g for women and 38 g for men. (Source: USDA)

A new analysis of almost 250 studies confirmed on a large scale that eating lots of fiber from vegetables, fruits, and whole grains can decrease your risk of dying from heart disease and cancer. Those who ate the most fiber reduced their risk of dying from cardiac disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes, and/or colon cancer by 16% to 24%, compared to people who ate very little fiber. The study also concluded that more fiber is better. For every additional 8 grams of dietary fiber a person consumed, the risk for each of the diseases fell by another 5% to 27%. Risk reductions were greatest when daily intake of dietary fiber was between 25 and 29 grams.

Eating too much fiber can cause bloating, gas, and constipation. These adverse effects may appear after eating 70 g of fiber in a day. (Source: medicalnewstoday)

# Fat (g)

The Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Range (AMDR) for fat is defined as a range of intake - with a lower and upper boundary - that is associated with reduced risk of chronic disease while providing adequate intake of essential nutrients.

The AMDR for fat is expressed as a percentage of total energy intake because its requirement is not independent of other energy fuel sources or of the total energy requirement of the individual. Thus, the AMDR is not considered a Dietary Reference Intake (DRI) that provides a defined intake level.

The AMDR for fat intake is 30-40% of total energy intake for children age 1-3 years, 25-35% of total energy intake for children age 4-18 years, and 20-35% of total energy intake for adults. For infants age 0-12 months, an Adequate Intake (AI) has been established in place of an AMDR.

# Omega-3 (ALA) (g)

Dietary Reference Intake (DRI) value for α-linolenic is represented by an Adequate Intake (AI), which represents the lower boundary of the Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Range (AMDR). The AI of 1.6 g for α-linolenic is based on the median intake of this fatty acid in the United States.

(Source: USDA)


Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Range (AMDR) is set at 0.6–1.2% of energy (as α-linolenic acid).

# Omega-6 (Linoleic Acid) (g)

Dietary Reference Intake (DRI) value for linoleic acid is represented by an Adequate Intake (AI), which represents the lower boundary of the Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Range (AMDR). The AI of 17 g for linoleic acid is based on the median intake of this fatty acid in the United States.

(Source: USDA)

Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Range (AMDR) is set at 5–10% of energy (as linolenic acid).
